# Property Analysis - BI Developer/Data Analyst Competition Sprint

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains solutions for the **BI Developer/Data Analyst Competition Sprint**, covering **Data Engineering, Power BI Visualization, and SSRS Reporting**. The project follows industry best practices in **Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analysis**, focusing on designing a **Data Warehouse, implementing an ETL pipeline, and creating interactive reports**.

## 📂 Project Components
### **Part 1: Data Engineering & Power BI**
- Designed and implemented a **Data Warehouse** for property data.
- Developed an **ETL pipeline using SSIS** for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Created a **Star Schema Model** with a **factless fact table** following **Kimball's methodology**.
- Developed **Power BI dashboards** for data visualization and analysis.

### **Part 2: SSRS Reporting**
- Designed **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports** for structured data representation.
- Implemented **parameterized reports** to enhance interactivity.
- Developed **drill-through and paginated reports** to provide detailed insights.
- Ensured optimized **query performance** for efficient reporting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL Server (SSMS, SSIS, SSRS)** for database management, ETL, and reporting.
- **Power BI** for interactive data visualization.
- **Kimball's Dimensional Modeling** for data structuring.

## 📸 Included Screenshots
- **SSIS Package (Control Flow & Data Flow)**
- **Star Schema Flowchart & Bus Matrix**
- **Loaded Data in SSMS Data Warehouse**
- **Power BI Dashboards**
- **SSRS Reports (Paginated & Drill-through Reports)**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/property-analysis
   ```
2. Open the SQL scripts and execute them in **SQL Server**.
3. Import the **SSIS package** into Visual Studio and run the ETL process.
4. Load **Power BI** and **SSRS reports** for data analysis and reporting.
